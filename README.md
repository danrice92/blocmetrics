## Blocmetrics

This is my third Rails project for my Software Engineering Track at [Bloc](http://bloc.io) called Blocmetrics. It is an analytics service to track events on websites.

Blocmetrics now allows users to create an account, verify their email, and add web apps to track.

Made with my mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io).
